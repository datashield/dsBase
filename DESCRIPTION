Title: 'DataSHIELD' Server Side Base Functions
Description: Base 'DataSHIELD' functions for the server side. 'DataSHIELD' is a software package which allows
    you to do non-disclosive federated analysis on sensitive data. 'DataSHIELD' analytic functions have
    been designed to only share non disclosive summary statistics, with built in automated output
    checking based on statistical disclosure control. With data sites setting the threshold values for
    the automated output checks. For more details, see 'citation("dsBase")'.
