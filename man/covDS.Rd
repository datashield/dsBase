\title{Computes the sum of each variable and the sum of products for each pair of variables}
\usage{
covDS(x = NULL, y = NULL, use = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character, the name of a vector, matrix or dataframe of variable(s) for which the covariance(s) and the
correlation(s) is (are) going to calculated for.}

\item{y}{NULL (default) or the name of a vector, matrix or dataframe with compatible dimensions to x.}

\item{use}{a character string giving a method for computing covariances in the presence of missing values.
This must be one of the strings "casewise.complete" or "pairwise.complete". If \code{use} is set to
'casewise.complete' then any rows with missing values are omitted from the vector, matrix or dataframe before the
calculations of the sums. If \code{use} is set to 'pairwise.complete' (which is the default case set on the client-side),
then the sums of products are computed for each two variables using only the complete pairs of observations on the
two variables.}
}
\value{
a list that includes a matrix with elements the sum of products between each two variables, a matrix with
elements the sum of the values of each variable, a matrix with elements the number of complete cases in each
pair of variables, a list with the number of missing values in each variable separately (columnwise) and the number
of missing values casewise or pairwise depending on the arqument \code{use}, and an error message which indicates
whether or not the input variables pass the disclosure controls. The first disclosure control checks that the number
of variables is not bigger than a percentage of the individual-level records (the allowed percentage is pre-specified
by the 'nfilter.glm'). The second disclosure control checks that none of them is dichotomous with a level having fewer
counts than the pre-specified 'nfilter.tab' threshold. If any of the input variables do not pass the disclosure
controls then all the output values are replaced with NAs.

\description{
This function computes the sum of each vector of variable and the sum of the products of each two
variables (i.e. the scalar product of each two vectors).
