\usage{
subsetByClassHelper2(df = NULL, iter = NULL, filter = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame.}

\item{iter}{the indices of columns to loop trough.}

\item{filter}{the minimum number of observations (i.e. rows) that are allowed.}
}
\value{

not factors.

\description{
This is an internal function called by the function 'subsetByClassDS'
}
\details{


The function generates subsets if the input of 'subsetByClassDS' is a data frame
and if the number variables(columns) to subset by are greater than 1; i.e. this
function is called if the user specified more than one variable or no variable to subset by
(if no variables are specified the function 'subsetByClassDS' produces a subset for each category
in each variable).
