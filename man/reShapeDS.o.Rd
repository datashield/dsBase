\usage{
reShapeDS.o(data.name, varying.transmit, v.names.transmit, timevar.name,
  idvar.name, drop.transmit, direction, sep)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.name, }{the name of the data.frame to be reshaped. Specified
via argument <data.name> of {ds.reShape.o} function}

\item{varying.transmit, }{names of sets of variables in the wide format that
correspond to single variables in long format (typically what may be called
'time-varying' or 'time-dependent' variables). Specified
via argument <varying> of {ds.reShape.o} function.}

\item{v.names.transmit, }{the names of variables in the long format that correspond
to multiple variables
in the wide format - for example, sbp7, sbp11, sbp15 (measured systolic blood pressure
at ages 7, 11 and 15 years). Specified
via argument <v.names> of {ds.reShape.o} function}

\item{timevar.name, }{the variable in long format that differentiates multiple records
from the same group or individual. Specified
via argument <timevar.name> of {ds.reShape.o} function}

\item{idvar.name, }{names of one or more variables in long format that identify
multiple records from
the same group/individual. This/these variable(s) may also be present in wide format.
Specified via argument <idvar.name> of {ds.reShape.o} function}

\item{drop.transmit, }{a vector of names of variables to drop before reshaping. Specified
via argument <drop> of {ds.reShape.o} function}

\item{direction, }{a character string, partially matched to either "wide" to reshape from 
long to wide format, or "long" to reshape from wide to long format. Specified
via argument <direction> of {ds.reShape.o} function}

\item{sep, }{a character vector of length 1, indicating a separating character in the variable
names in the wide format. Specified
via argument <sep> of {ds.reShape.o} function}
}
\value{
a reshaped data.frame converted from long to wide format or from wide to
long format which is written to the serverside and given the name provided as the
<newobj> argument of {ds.reShape.o} or 'newObject' if no name is specified.
In addition, two validity messages are returned to the clientside
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form (see header for {ds.reShape.o}.
}
\description{
Reshapes a data frame containing longitudinal or
otherwise grouped data from 'wide' to 'long' format or vice-versa
}
\details{
This function is based on the native R function \code{reshape}.
It reshapes a data frame containing longitudinal or otherwise grouped data
between 'wide' format with repeated
measurements in separate columns of the same record and 'long' format with the repeated
measurements in separate records. The reshaping can be in either direction
