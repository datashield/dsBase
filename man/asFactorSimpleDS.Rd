\description{
This function is an assign DataSHIELD function that coerces
a numeric or character vector into a factor
}
\details{
The functions converts the input variable into a factor. Unlike 
ds.asFactor and its serverside functions, ds.asFactorSimple does no more than
coerce the class of a variable to factor in each study. It does not check for 
or enforce consistency of factor levels across sources or allow you to
force an arbitrary set of levels unless those levels actually exist in the sources.
In addition, it does not allow you to create an array of
binary dummy variables that is equivalent to a factor. If you need to do any
of these things you will have to use the ds.asFactor function.
