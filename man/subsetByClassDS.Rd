\title{Breaks down a dataframe or a factor into its sub-classes}
\usage{
subsetByClassDS(data = NULL, variables = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a string character, the name of the dataframe or the factor vector}

\item{variables}{a vector of string characters, the names of the the variables to subset on.}
}
\value{
a list which contains the subsetted datasets
}
\description{
The function takes a categorical vector or dataframe as input and generates subset(s)
vectors or dataframes for each category. Subsets are considered invalid if they hold between 1 and
4 observations.
}
\details{


If the input data object is a dataframe it is possible to specify  the variables
to subset on. If a subset is not 'valid' all its the values are reported as missing (i.e. NA),
the name of the subsets is labelled as '_INVALID'. If no variables are specified to subset on,
the dataframe will be subset on each of its factor variables.
And if none of the columns holds a factor variable a message is issued as output. A message is also
issued as output if the input vector is not of type factor.
