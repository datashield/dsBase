\title{Turns a numeric vector into a factor vector}
\usage{
asFactorDS(x = character(), levels, labels = levels, exclude = NA,
  ordered = is.ordered(x))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of data, usually taking a small number of distinct values.}

\item{levels}{an optional vector of the values (as character strings) that x might have taken.}

\item{labels}{either an optional character vector of labels for the levels (in the same order
as levels after removing those in exclude), or a character string of length 1.}

\item{exclude}{a vector of values to be excluded when forming the set of levels.
This should be of the same type as x, and will be coerced if necessary.}

\item{ordered}{logical flag to determine if the levels should be regarded as ordered (in the order given).}
}
\value{
an object of class 'factor' or NULL if the resulting factor is invalid
}
\description{
this function is similar to R function \code{as.factor} except for
the fact that it does not allow for levels with one observation only.
