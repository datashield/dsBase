\title{Creates 2-dimensional contingency tables}
\usage{
table2dDS(xvect, yvect)
}
\arguments{
\item{xvect}{a numerical vector with discrete values - usually a factor.}

\item{yvect}{a numerical vector with discrete values - usually a factor.}
}
\value{
a list which contains two elements: 'table', the 1-dimensional table and 'message' a message which
informs about the validity of the table.
}
\description{
This function generates a 2-dimensional table where potentially disclosive cells
(based on the set threshold) are replaced by a missing value ('NA').
}
\details{


It generates a 2-dimensional tables where valid (non-disclosive) 2-dimensional tables are defined
as data from sources where no table cells have counts between 1 and the set threshold. When the ouput table
is invalid all cells but the total counts are replaced by missing values. Only the total counts are visible
on the table returned to the client site. A message is also returned with the 2-dimensional table; the message
says "invalid table - invalid counts present" if the table is invalid and 'valid table' otherwise.
