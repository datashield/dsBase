\title{Changes a reference level of a factor}
\usage{
changeRefGroupDS(xvect, ref = NULL, reorderByRef = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xvect}{a factor vector}

\item{ref}{a character, the reference level}

\item{reorderByRef}{a boolean that tells whether or not the new
vector should be ordered by the reference group.}
}
\value{
a factor of the same length as xvect
}
\description{
This function is similar to R function \code{relevel},
}
\details{


In addition to what the R function does, this function
allows for the user to re-order the vector, putting the reference
group first. If the user chooses the re-order a warning is issued
as this can introduce a mismatch of values if the vector is put back
into a table that is not reordered in the same way. Such mismatch
can render the results of operations on that table invalid.
