\title{Converts a numeric vector into a factor}
\usage{
asFactorDS2(
  input.var.name = NULL,
  all.unique.levels.transmit = NULL,
  fixed.dummy.vars = NULL,
  baseline.level = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.var.name}{the name of the variable that is to be converted to a factor.}

\item{all.unique.levels.transmit}{the levels that the variable will be transmitted to.}

\item{fixed.dummy.vars}{a boolean that determines whether the new object will be represented as
a vector or as a matrix of dummy variables indicating the factor level of each data point.
If this argyment is set to FALSE (default) then the input variable is converted to a factor and
assigned as a vector. If is set to TRUE then the input variable is converted to a factor but
assigned as a matrix of dummy variables.}

\item{baseline.level}{a number indicating the baseline level to be used in the creation of the
matrix of dummy variables.}
}
\value{
an object of class factor
}
\description{
This function is an assign DataSHIELD function that converts a numeric vector into
a factor type that presented as a vector or as a matrix with dummy variables.
}
\details{
The functions converts the input variable into a factor which is presented as a vector
if the \code{fixed.dummy.vars} is set to FALSE or as a matrix with dummy variables if the
\code{fixed.dummy.vars} is set to TRUE (see the help file of ds.asFactor.b for more details).
